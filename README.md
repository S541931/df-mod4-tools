## Exercise 1: Autopsy
* In this exercise
* Hash Database can be used on multiple facets of an investigation, being able to import them instead of recreating them in every application saves a lot of time and prevents many human errors.

## Exercise 2: Autopsy
* In this exercise
* Hash Database allows you to index and retrieve items in a database quickly, while avoiding files that you may not need. Autopsy gives us a very convenient method of creating these Hash Databases while we are going through the evidence, letting us archive what is known, notable, or files that need to be investigated further.

## Exercise 3: Hex Editor
* In this exercise
* While Hex Editors have many uses with this exercise we are using them as a quick and simple way to find the Hash for files or Hash of sections of files. Using the Hex Editor in this way is usefull in matching File Remnants.

## Exercise 4: Bit Shifting
* In this exercise
* Files are in the Exercise 4 Folder. I have made sure the SHA256 of evidence.txt and recovered.txt match, while nothing.txt is different

## Exercise 5: Autopsy - Crack Password with Rainbow Table
* I made use of both outside resources and my classmates but was unable to complete this exercise in the end. The Rainbow table provided in the textbook was unfortunately too large a file to make use of with my school computer and I am unsure about how I should even start with the creation of a new Rainbow Table.
* I did make use of a fully online Resource to crack multiple passwords of varying complexities, but it did not allow me to see the results this exercises desired.
* In this exercise
